# MorseTranslator
This is my Morse Code Translator.
It can translate morse code into text or text into morse code.
I programmed this in the language of python.
I got into this after learning morse code and after watching many coding styles for this project mainly one from geeks-for-geeks
Thanks for checking my project out.
